Highlevel Flow of run_analysis.R script

1. features.txt file is transposed to use as column names for x train and x test datasets
2. X_train and x_test datasets have been subsetted to bring in only mean and std deviation columns
3. x train, y train datasets have been merged with subject train datasets to merge
subject id, activity id and activity description and all mean and standard deviation measures
4. Similarly, x test, y test datasets have been merged with subject test datasets to merge
subject id, activity id and activity description and all mean and standard deviation measures
5. Step 3 and Step 4 are appended rowwise
6. Average function is performed on all mean and standard deviation measures for each subject and activity
7. The result set is exported into a text file

Detailed comments are available in the scripts. All checks performed to ensure that source data is clean has been 
documented in the comments of the script

The tidy dataset contains 82 columns
Subject_ID - This is the ID to uniquely identify a subject
Activity_ID - This is the ID to uniquely identify a activity
