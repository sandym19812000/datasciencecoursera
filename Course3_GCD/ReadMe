Highlevel Flow of run_analysis.R script

1. features.txt file is transposed to use as column names for x train and x test datasets
2. X_train and x_test datasets have been subsetted to bring in only mean and std deviation columns
3. x train, y train datasets have been merged with subject train datasets to merge
subject id, activity id and activity description and all mean and standard deviation measures
4. Similarly, x test, y test datasets have been merged with subject test datasets to merge
subject id, activity id and activity description and all mean and standard deviation measures
5. Step 3 and Step 4 are appended rowwise
6. Average function is performed on all mean and standard deviation measures for each subject and activity
7. The result set is exported into a text file

Detailed comments are available in the scripts. All checks performed to ensure that source data is clean has been 
documented in the comments of the script
